# About this project

This project is aimed to choose suitable argument for the given load balancing algorithms and then analysis the performance of different servers. To do this, I need to write a program to simulate two servers and use some statistical method to analysis the data, then calculate the argument from it.  

`project-v1.02.pdf` is the specification of the project, and the report is located in `code/report.md` which contains the description about the code, and the analysis of the simulation.
